# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BCI computes coarse-grained kinetic and available potential energy (APE) budgets for an idealized
baroclinic-instability channel, using the Winters et al. (1995) sorting method for APE and the
Aluie et al. (2018, JPO) coarse-graining framework for cross-scale KE/APE transfer. This is a fork of
[CoarseGrainedKHAPE](https://github.com/tomchor/CoarseGrainedKHAPE) (which targets a 2D x–z
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability), adapted to a 3D **double-front, doubly-periodic-horizontal** baroclinic
adjustment setup (following the [Oceananigans baroclinic_adjustment
example](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/literated/baroclinic_adjustment)). The
pipeline is:
1. **Julia simulation** (Oceananigans.jl `NonhydrostaticModel`) -> NetCDF output
2. **Python post-processing** -> filter fields, sort density, compute energy transfer and SFS budgets, plot

GitHub remote: `git@github.com:wenegrat/CoarseGrainedBCI.git` (fork of `tomchor/CoarseGrainedKHAPE`,
tracked as the `upstream` remote)

## Running the Code

### Simulation
```bash
julia --project -t 8 baroclinic_adjustment.jl                     # default resolution (48x48x8), 20 days
julia --project -t 8 baroclinic_adjustment.jl --stop_time 1        # short run
julia --project -t 8 baroclinic_adjustment.jl --Nx 16 --Ny 16 --Nz 4 --stop_time 0.05 --progress_interval 1   # tiny smoke test
```
CLI args: `--Nx`, `--Ny`, `--Nz` (default 48, 48, 8), `--N2`, `--M2`, `--front_width`, `--perturbation_amplitude`,
`--latitude`, `--nu`, `--Pr`, `--stop_time` (days, default 20), `--filter_scales_m` (two horizontal FWHM scales
in meters, default 50000 100000 -- matches the units used throughout the offline post-processing pipeline;
renamed from the old km-based `--filter_scales` specifically so a stale invocation fails loudly instead of
silently applying scales 1000x too small), `--progress_interval` (default 100; use a small value for
short/smoke-test runs where the default interval may never be reached), `--advection_scheme` (`centered`
default or `weno`), `--closure` (`scale_aware` default, `constant`, or `smagorinsky`) with its `--Pe_cell_h`/
`--Pe_cell_v`/`--nu_h`/`--nu_v`/`--Pr` sub-parameters, `--architecture` (`auto` default -- uses a GPU if
`CUDA.functional()`, else `CPU()`; `cpu`/`gpu` to force one, `gpu` erroring loudly instead of silently
falling back if no GPU is found), `--implicit` (boolean flag, default false; forces `--closure=nothing` and
`--advection_scheme=WENO(order=--implicit_weno_order)` -- fully implicit/numerical dissipation, an
implicit-LES configuration -- warning and overriding, not erroring, if `--closure`/`--advection_scheme`/
`--Pe_cell_h`/`--Pe_cell_v`/`--nu_h`/`--nu_v` were also explicitly set; see "Implicit-LES mode" below for
the diagnostic implications) with its `--implicit_weno_order` sub-parameter (`5` or `9`, default `9`;
ignored unless `--implicit`), `--bottom_drag` (boolean, default false; quadratic bottom drag -- see "Bottom
drag" below) with its `--z0` sub-parameter. See the file's own `--help` for full documentation of each.

**Implicit-LES mode (`--implicit`, `--implicit_weno_order`):** `--implicit_weno_order` (5 or 9, default 9)
picks the WENO order used for the forced advection scheme -- lower order is a less compact/less
dissipative stencil, so 5 vs. 9 are both valid implicit-LES configurations with different amounts of
implicit numerical dissipation, offered for comparison rather than one being "correct." Both are odd orders
Oceananigans' `WENO` accepts; the halo auto-inflation (below) adjusts accordingly -- order 9 needs halo≥5,
order 5 only needs halo≥3 (already satisfied by the base grid, so no inflation happens for order 5).

The online `ε_Kˢ`/`εˡ` SFS dissipation diagnostics and the offline APE
dissipation term both derive from an explicit closure's ν/κ, which is `nothing` under `--implicit` -- they
read ~0 rather than the real (but numerical, untracked) dissipation actually happening via WENO's own
implicit truncation error. `04_sfs_ke_budget.py`/`05_sfs_ape_budget.py` detect this via the simulation's own
`implicit` NetCDF attribute and substitute a residual-based estimate for the domain-*integrated* ε_Kˢ/ε_Aˢ
only (solving the budget for ε_Kˢ/ε_Aˢ assuming every other term is correct, which makes `residual_K`/
`residual_A` ≈0 by construction) -- the *local* (spatial) `ε_Kˢ`/`ε_Aˢ` fields are left at their
uninformative near-zero values, since a local residual would also absorb real spatial transport/
flux-divergence terms that only vanish upon domain integration, not pointwise. Both substituted variables
carry a `method` attribute in the output NetCDF recording this. This residual-based estimate can go
negative at some times (unlike a true dissipation rate), since it's absorbing whatever error/noise sits in
the other terms -- expected, not a bug. `06_plot_budgets.py`/`plot3_budgets.py`/`plot5`/`plot6`/`anim3` need
no changes, since they consume the same variable names either way. Also note: `NetCDFWriter`'s NCDatasets.jl
backend cannot write a raw Julia `Bool` as a NetCDF attribute at all (confirmed -- errors "KeyError: key Bool
not found"); `implicit` is written as `Int` (0/1) via a separate `netcdf_attributes` namedtuple, keeping
`params.implicit` a genuine `Bool` for use in conditionals earlier in the file.

**Bottom drag (`--bottom_drag`, `--z0`):** quadratic drag `τ = Cd|U|u` (`U=(u,v,w)` at the bottom cell)
applied as a `FluxBoundaryCondition` on `u`/`v` at the bottom only, following
[whitleyv/IntWaveSlope](https://github.com/whitleyv/IntWaveSlope/blob/main/Simulations/IntWave.jl). `Cd =
(κᵥₖ/log(Δz/(2·z0)))²` (Monin-Obukhov log law, `κᵥₖ=0.4` fixed, `z0` the roughness length in meters via
`--z0`, default 0.01) -- **resolution-dependent by design**: the same `z0` gives different `Cd` at different
`Nz`, since it's a log law evaluated at the first grid point above the bottom, not a fixed physical
constant. `Cd` is passed to the boundary function via `parameters=`, not closed over as a global (a
non-const global referenced inside a per-timestep, per-cell hot-path function is a real Julia performance
trap). When enabled, three new online diagnostic fields are written per filter scale to a separate
`_bottom.nc` file (`indices=(:,:,1)`, `ConsecutiveIterations` schedule matching `:fields` -- **not** plain
`TimeInterval` like `:surface`, since these fields get combined with `:fields`-derived quantities offline
and need the same time grid; confirmed necessary directly, a first attempt with `TimeInterval` produced
silent all-NaN results downstream): `τx_b_ℓ{scale}km`/`τy_b_ℓ{scale}km` (filtered bottom stress
components) and `τu_b_ℓ{scale}km` (filtered pointwise drag work `overline{τ·u_b}`).

Offline (`04_sfs_ke_budget.py`), when `ds.attrs["bottom_drag"]` is true: assembles the large-scale term
`-(τ̄·ū_b)` (`ū_b`/`v̄_b` reuse the already-filtered `u_ℓ`/`v_ℓ` sliced at the bottom -- no new computation)
and the SFS term `-(overline{τ·u_b} - τ̄·ū_b)`, both **area**-integrated (`dA = Δx·Δy`, not the volume `dV`
every other term uses -- bottom drag is a boundary process). The SFS term is folded into `residual_K`
(a new sink in the SFS KE budget); the large-scale term is recorded as a standalone diagnostic only --
there's no full large-scale/filtered KE budget assembly in this pipeline yet (see the εˡ note above), so it
isn't wired into any budget equation. Both terms are always negative by construction (`τ·u_b ≥ 0`
pointwise, since drag magnitude and velocity share the same sign by construction -- verified directly on a
real test run). `06_plot_budgets.py`/`plot3_budgets.py`/`anim3_panels.py` all show both terms when present,
gated on the variable actually existing in the budget file (so non-bottom-drag runs are unaffected).

**Interaction with `--implicit`:** when both flags are active, `04_sfs_ke_budget.py`'s residual-based `ε_Kˢ`
estimate (see above) also subtracts `int_bottom_drag_work_SFS`, not just `Πₖ + exchange - ∂ₜE_K^s` --
otherwise the bottom-drag SFS sink (a real, independently-diagnosed physical term, not numerical
dissipation) would leak into `residual_K` instead of being absorbed like everything else, breaking the
"`residual_K` ≈0 by construction" sanity check that's the whole point of the implicit substitution.
Confirmed directly: without this, `residual_K` came out identical to `∫-(bottom drag work, SFS) dA`
exactly. The bottom-drag computation was also reordered to run *before* the `--implicit` block (previously
independent, since neither branch was ever tested with the other active) so `int_bottom_drag_work_SFS`
exists by the time it's needed. `--implicit` alone (no bottom drag) is unaffected -- the extra subtraction
is itself gated on `bottom_drag`.

**Post-processing write mode (`--write-mode`, `01_filter_fields.py`/`03_energy_transfer.py`/
`04_sfs_ke_budget.py`/`05_sfs_ape_budget.py`/`sweep2_energy_transfer.py`):** `{load,synchronous}`, default
`load`. Both avoid the same
underlying bug: writing a Dataset that still has unevaluated dask arrays computes them via dask's default
*threaded* scheduler *during* the `.to_netcdf()` call, with multiple threads writing into the same HDF5 file
handle -- a real, observed hang (a checkpoint write once sat at 0% progress for 38+ minutes with near-zero
CPU, not a crash), since the underlying HDF5 C library isn't reliably thread-safe for concurrent writes.
`load` eagerly `.load()`s the full Dataset into memory before writing -- fast, but needs the whole thing to
fit in memory at once (OOMs at large resolutions, e.g. 512x512x128). `synchronous` forces dask's
single-threaded scheduler for just the write, which still streams/computes chunk-by-chunk (bounded memory)
but avoids the hang -- measured ~30% slower than `load` for `01_filter_fields.py` at 256x256x64
(`test_write_scheduler_timing.pbs`, both modes run back-to-back on the same node/input so only the write
strategy differs). `01_filter_fields.py` also has `--output-suffix` (appended before `.nc`) so a
`load`-vs-`synchronous` timing comparison run against the same input doesn't overwrite itself.
`budgeting.pbs`/`budgeting_filter.pbs`/`sweep_filter.pbs`/`sweep_transfer.pbs` default to
`WRITE_MODE=synchronous` (override via `-v WRITE_MODE=load`) -- these are the production-scale jobs this
mode exists for, so defaulting to safe-but-slower avoids silently falling back to the mode that fails at
scale. The shared `write_dataset()` helper (`aux00_utils.py`) implements both; `02_sort_density.py` has no
`--write-mode` flag at all, since `sorted_timeseries()` builds its result from eager numpy throughout (no
lazy graph ever reaches its write) -- see the Notes entry on `sorted_timeseries()`/
`local_potential_energies_timeseries()`'s memory fixes for why that script OOM'd anyway at high time
resolution, a completely different mechanism than the write hang.

### HPC job submission

`submit_*.sh`/`*.pbs` (repo root and `postprocessing/`) are adapted for `baroclinic_adjustment.jl`/BCI
naming (`bci_Nx${NX}_Ny${NY}_Nz${NZ}`), chained via `qsub -W depend=afterok`. Four entry points, depending
on how much of the pipeline you need:

| Script | Stages run | Use when |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `bash submit_all_pbs.sh` | simulation → budgeting_filter → budgeting → plots (+ sweep_filter → sweep_transfer if `SWEEP=1`) | starting from scratch |
| `bash submit_simulation.sh` | simulation only | you only want the `.nc` output, no post-processing yet |
| `bash postprocessing/submit_budgeting.sh` | budgeting_filter → budgeting → plots | simulation already completed, (re)run analysis only (e.g. after changing filter scales, or after the simulation succeeded but post-processing failed) |
| `bash postprocessing/submit_sweep.sh` | sweep_filter → sweep_transfer | just the many-filter-scale transfer-spectrum sweep, independent of the fixed-2-scale budgeting above |

```bash
# Full pipeline, WENO advection on a GPU
bash submit_all_pbs.sh NX=128 NY=128 NZ=64 STOP_TIME=20 \
    EXTRA_ARGS='--advection_scheme weno --Pe_cell_h 50 --Pe_cell_v 50' GPU=1

# Simulation only
bash submit_simulation.sh NX=384 NY=384 NZ=128 STOP_TIME=16 GPU=1

# Post-processing only, against an already-completed simulation
cd postprocessing && bash submit_budgeting.sh NX=384 NY=384 NZ=128

# Many-filter-scale sweep only
cd postprocessing && bash submit_sweep.sh NX=384 NY=384 NZ=128
```

Shared flags across the scripts that take them: `NX`/`NY`/`NZ` (grid resolution), `STOP_TIME` (simulation
days, `submit_all_pbs.sh`/`submit_simulation.sh` only), `EXTRA_ARGS` (extra `baroclinic_adjustment.jl` CLI
args passed through verbatim -- quote multi-word values), `GPU=1` (requests an A100 for the simulation
stage only via a `qsub -l` override, since `#PBS` directives are static; post-processing stages are pure
CPU/numpy/dask regardless), `FILTER_SCALES_M` (offline post-processing filter scales in **meters**, passed
to `budgeting_filter.pbs`/`01_filter_fields.py` and `plots.pbs` -- **left unset by default**, which means
"use whatever the simulation actually used" rather than a separate hardcoded default; see the "Filter
scales: single source of truth" note below), `FIXED_REF=0|1|both` (fixed-in-time vs. recomputed reference
density profile; `both` submits both budgeting variants, sharing one filter-step run), `SWEEP=1`
(`submit_all_pbs.sh` only, adds the sweep branch after budgeting), `WRITE_MODE` (`budgeting.pbs`/
`budgeting_filter.pbs`/`sweep_filter.pbs`/`sweep_transfer.pbs` only, passed through to the underlying
scripts' own `--write-mode` -- see "Post-processing write mode" above; left unset means "use that PBS
script's own default," which is `synchronous` for all four).

**Filter scales: single source of truth.** `baroclinic_adjustment.jl`'s `--filter_scales_m` (online
diagnostics) and the offline pipeline's `--filter-scales`/`FILTER_SCALES_M` used to be two fully independent
knobs with matching-but-separate hardcoded defaults (`50000 100000` in both places) -- easy to let drift
silently, since nothing checked they agreed. Fixed by making the simulation's own choice the source of
truth for the common case: `filter_scales_m` is now recorded as a NetCDF global attribute (confirmed
NCDatasets.jl writes/reads a `Vector{Float64}` attribute cleanly, unlike `Bool` -- see the `--implicit`
branch's NetCDF-attribute gotcha), and every offline script that previously hardcoded `[50000, 100000]` as
its `--filter-scales`/`--filter-scale` default now instead falls back to reading that attribute when the
flag isn't explicitly passed:
- `01_filter_fields.py` -- defaults to `ds.attrs["filter_scales_m"]` (falls back to `[50000, 100000]` only
  for older files that predate the attribute)
- `plot3_budgets.py` -- defaults to the first two scales actually present in the budget file's own
  `filter_scale` coordinate (which reflects whatever `01_filter_fields.py` actually used, so this is
  consistent with the point above by construction)
- `budgeting_filter.pbs`/`plots.pbs` -- `FILTER_SCALES_M` unset means "don't pass `--filter-scales` at
  all", letting the Python scripts' new defaults take over; `plots.pbs`'s per-scale loop (driving
  `plot5`/`plot6`/`anim3`) falls back to every scale in the budget file when `FILTER_SCALES_M` is unset

Passing `--filter-scales`/`FILTER_SCALES_M` explicitly still works exactly as before (deliberately using
different offline scales than the simulation's online ones is a real, intentional workflow -- re-exploring
offline without rerunning the simulation). The only thing that changed is what happens when you *don't*
specify it: previously a silent, independently-hardcoded guess; now derived from the one place that
actually knows what was used.

The `plots` stage runs `plot3_budgets.py`; `plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py`/`plot6_snapshots.py`/
`plot7_flux_phase_space.py` (once per filter scale -- `FILTER_SCALES_M` if set, else every scale in the
budget file -- and, within that, once per depth in `Z_VALUES_M`, default `"-500 0"` i.e. mid-depth then
surface; override with a different space-separated list of meters if those two aren't what you want);
`anim2_surface_buoyancy.py`; and `anim3_panels.py` (once per filter scale) -- the latter depends
specifically on the `FIXED_REF=0` budgeting output (no `--fixed-reference` support in the plotting scripts
themselves), so `submit_budgeting.sh` skips plots automatically if only `FIXED_REF=1` was requested.
`plot5`/`plot7` also share the same `--time-min`/`--time-max` pooling (see their own Architecture entries),
left unpassed here deliberately -- `plots.pbs` used to override both to the run's own last 10 days, but that
meant the window silently shifted with each run's length instead of every run being plotted over the same
fixed 15-30 day window; removed once that turned out to be the more confusing behavior in practice (a real
run came back plotted over days 30-40, not the 15-30 a reader would expect from the scripts' own default).
All three of `plot5`/`plot6`/`plot7` take `--z` (meters, nearest available
cell center; each script's own default is mid-depth, `-500`) and bake the *resolved* depth into their output
filename (`z{z_m}m`, from the actual nearest-cell value, not the raw `--z` request) so running the same
filter scale at two different depths doesn't silently overwrite the
first file with the second -- neither filename included depth at all before this.

**Post-processing memory sizing.** Every `*.pbs` file's `#PBS -l select=...mem=...` is a *static* resource
request that doesn't scale with `NX*NY*NZ` (or with simulation length) automatically -- `simulation.pbs`
defaults to `mem=64GB`, sized for a modest resolution; bump it by hand for much larger grids.
`budgeting.pbs`/`budgeting_filter.pbs`/`sweep_filter.pbs`/`sweep_transfer.pbs` have all needed bumping in
practice (`budgeting_filter.pbs` needed 384GB at 512x512x128; `budgeting.pbs` needed 384GB then 732GB
chasing real OOMs at 512x512x128 and then a 256x256x64-but-961-timestep run; `sweep_filter.pbs`/
`sweep_transfer.pbs` bumped to 732GB alongside it). The 961-timestep case is the important lesson: it OOM'd
at the *same* memory budget that had just worked fine on a *larger-grid* 512x512x128/81-timestep run,
because the dominant cost in `02_sort_density.py`/`03_energy_transfer.py` (via `sorted_timeseries()`/
`local_potential_energies_timeseries()`, see Notes) scales with `n_times × Nx × Ny × Nz`, not grid size
alone -- a long, fine-time-resolution run can need more memory than a much bigger single-snapshot-heavy
grid. Those two functions have since been rewritten to cut their own peak memory substantially (see Notes),
but the underlying guidance stands: if a run has an unusually large *time* dimension (many timesteps, e.g.
from a small `--output_interval_hours`), don't assume a mem budget that worked at a similar grid size but
far fewer timesteps will still be enough. **Before first use**, every `*.pbs` file needs
its `#PBS -A`/`#PBS -M` placeholders (`CHANGE_ME`) replaced with your own account code and email (PBS
directives are parsed statically, so these can't be centralized), and `hpc_env.sh`'s `PYTHON` placeholder
needs to point at your own HPC Python environment (must have `postprocessing/tests/requirements.txt`
installed).

**Output storage on the HPC:** `output/` and `postprocessing/output/` are *not* plain directories on the
HPC -- they're symlinks into scratch space (e.g. `/glade/derecho/scratch/$USER/CoarseGrainedBCI/output/`
and `.../CoarseGrainedBCI/postprocessing/output/`, mirroring the repo's own layout), because HPC home
directories tend to have small quotas (100GB is common) that large-resolution runs blow through fast --
raw simulation NetCDFs and derived post-processing files (filtered velocities, energy transfer, SFS
budgets) both scale steeply with `Nx*Ny*Nz` and can reach 10s-100s of GB each at resolutions like
384x384x128. Both directories are fully gitignored (not just their `*.nc` contents) specifically because
git refuses to operate on tracked paths that sit behind a symlinked directory ("beyond a symbolic link"
fatal errors on `git stash`/checkout/etc if a `.gitkeep` is still tracked underneath one). A fresh
checkout needs these created manually before first use: a plain `mkdir output postprocessing/output` for
local (non-HPC) development, or the scratch-symlink setup above for the HPC. This is unrelated to (but
was investigated alongside) a separate large consumer of HPC home quota: the Julia package depot
(`~/.julia`, ~60GB with CUDA artifacts) defaults to the home directory unless `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` is set.
On this HPC it's been migrated to `$WORK/.julia` (`mv ~/.julia $WORK/.julia`), with `export
JULIA_DEPOT_PATH="$WORK/.julia"` set in `~/.bash_profile` so interactive shells and any `#!/bin/bash -l`
(login-shell) PBS script -- including `simulation.pbs`, which also sets it explicitly as a version-controlled
safety net -- all agree on the same depot. Moving the depot invalidates Julia's precompiled cache (paths
are baked in), so expect a one-time recompile the first time each package is used afterward. A fresh
checkout/user on this HPC needs the same migration + `~/.bash_profile` line repeated -- it isn't captured
by the repo alone, since it's personal shell config.

### Post-processing
```bash
cd postprocessing
bash 00_get_budgets.sh output/bci_Nx48_Ny48_Nz8.nc --filter-scales 50000 100000
```
Set `N_WORKERS` env var to control parallelism (default 1): `N_WORKERS=4 bash 00_get_budgets.sh ...`

### Running tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -s
```
`test_budgets.py` checks SFS KE/APE budget closure (rms(residual)/min(rms(terms)) < 10%) against
`postprocessing/output/bci_Nx48_Ny48_Nz8_*` (run `00_get_budgets.sh` first). Historically failed; see the
Notes entry on the domain-padding bug fix below before assuming it still does -- that bug inflated every
budget term computed on this dataset too, and hasn't yet been re-checked against this specific test.

### Python environment
The repo's `environment.yml` is a Linux-only conda lockfile (built on an HPC). For local development
(e.g. macOS), create a plain venv instead:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

### Julia environment
Requires Julia 1.11.x (matching the HPC target). Use `juliaup` to manage multiple Julia versions
side by side; `juliaup override set 1.11.2` pins this directory to the right version so a bare `julia`
invocation picks it up automatically.

## Architecture

### Physical setup (`baroclinic_adjustment.jl`)
- Model: `NonhydrostaticModel` (no free surface at all -- see Notes for why this replaced the earlier
  `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`+`ImplicitFreeSurface` setup), `BetaPlane` Coriolis, `BuoyancyTracer`,
  `Centered(order=4)` advection, `ScalarDiffusivity(ν, κ)` closure. w is a genuine prognostic variable
  here, with its own momentum equation and dissipative dynamics.
- Grid: `(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)` -- a **double front** rather than a single front against channel
  walls: two opposite-signed buoyancy ramps (`double_ramp`) so the field closes periodically in y. This
  avoids side-wall boundary layers (an extra KE sink the budget would otherwise need to account for) and
  means the horizontal Gaussian filter is a pure periodic wrap in both directions, with no edge-extension
  boundary handling needed.
- Velocities are interpolated to `(Center, Center, Center)` (`u_center`/`v_center`/`w_center`) before being
  written to output or filtered. Writing the raw staggered (Face) velocities instead breaks the offline
  Python tensor math silently (products of fields at mismatched staggered locations broadcast across extra
  coordinate dimensions instead of multiplying pointwise) -- this bit us once during testing; see Notes.
- The coarse-graining filter is **horizontal-only** (x, y) -- it never touches z. Horizontal scales span the
  mesoscale/submesoscale range this budget targets; z has its own distinct structure (stratification,
  boundary layers) that shouldn't be smoothed over.
- Grid halo is sized explicitly (`halo=(Hx,Hy,3)`) from the largest requested filter scale's stencil radius
  (4σ truncation). The default halo Oceananigans picks is sized for the advection scheme, not for a wide
  Gaussian filter stencil -- an undersized halo causes silent memory corruption (a segfault at an unrelated
  *later* point, not a clean bounds-check error), not an immediate crash at the filter call site.
- **Πₖ (cross-scale KE flux) and ε_Kˢ (SFS KE dissipation) are computed online**, via Oceanostics'
  `KineticEnergyCrossScaleFlux`/`SubFilterKineticEnergyDissipationRate`, one field per filter scale
  (`Π_K_ℓ50km`, `ε_Kˢ_ℓ50km`, etc.). This used to be offline-only (an Oceanostics bug crashed the online
  multi-direction `GaussianFilter` for a periodic y-direction -- see Notes) but the fix landed in
  Oceanostics v0.17.3, and `SubFilterKineticEnergyDissipationRate` (the missing SFS-dissipation
  diagnostic) was added in the `tc/sfs-ke` branch (pinned in `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml` via
  `Pkg.add(url=..., rev="tc/sfs-ke")`). tomchor/Oceanostics.jl#266, the PR behind that branch, has since
  merged (2026-07-16) -- the pin could move to a proper tagged release/`main` instead of the branch; see the
  Notes entry below on a newer `main`-branch Oceanostics module this pin doesn't include for why that's now
  more than a tidiness concern. Both were validated against the previous offline
  Python implementation before switching over (0.99 spatial correlation, rms agreement within ~1-10%).
- Πₖ is the **full 3D contraction** (`KineticEnergyCrossScaleFlux(model, filter; dims=(1,2,3))`): w is a
  genuine prognostic variable in this `NonhydrostaticModel`, with its own momentum equation and dissipative
  dynamics, so there's no reason to exclude it (unlike the earlier `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` setup,
  where w was diagnostic and excluding it was necessary for the KE budget to close even in principle).
  ε_Kˢ's public API has no `dims` restriction at all -- it always includes w's full contribution via the
  model's actual per-direction viscous fluxes, which is simply correct now rather than the small "phantom"
  w-diffusion term it represented under the old hydrostatic setup (verified negligible there, ~1e-8
  relative magnitude, via a validation smoke test). The offline SFS KE budget pipeline
  (`04_sfs_ke_budget.py`, `calculate_energy_transfer()`) was updated to match -- the SFS KE density and
  offline Π_K (validation-only; Π_K is read from the online output in practice) are now full 3D too.
- `utils.jl` -- `closest_factor_number()` (FFT-friendly grid sizes), `show_gpu_status()` (unchanged from KH).

### Post-processing pipeline (`postprocessing/`)
Same 01-06 structure as KHAPE, adapted for horizontal (x,y) filtering instead of KH's (x,z):

| Script | Change from KHAPE |
|--------|--------|
| `01_filter_fields.py` | filters in (x,y) instead of (x,z); filter scales are free parameters again (no longer need to match an online `filter_ℓs`) |
| `02_sort_density.py` | unchanged -- the Winters sort is dimension-agnostic |
| `03_energy_transfer.py` | Πₖ is no longer computed here (`include_pi_k=False`) -- it's read straight from the simulation NetCDF now; still computes Π_A and the APE↔KE exchange offline. Loops over filter scales one at a time (calling `calculate_energy_transfer()` with a single-element list per scale) and checkpoints each scale to disk before moving to the next -- see "Checkpointing and cross-script reuse" below |
| `04_sfs_ke_budget.py` | reads Πₖ and ε_Kˢ directly from the simulation output (`ds[f"Π_K_ℓ{ℓ_km}km"]`, `ds[f"ε_Kˢ_ℓ{ℓ_km}km"]`) instead of computing/loading them; still computes the SFS KE density (LHS) offline via the stress-tensor trace, full 3D (i,j ∈ {1,2,3}) to stay dimensionally consistent with the online Πₖ/ε_Kˢ now that w is prognostic. Also checkpoints per filter scale (see below); still independently recomputes `b_r`/the APE↔KE exchange term that `03` already computed and persisted -- a known, not-yet-fixed duplication, see Notes |
| `05_sfs_ape_budget.py` | filters in (x,y); diffusivity κ now read from `nu`/`Pr` global attributes (a constant `ScalarDiffusivity`), not a `ds.κ` spatial field (which only exists for non-constant closures and was never actually populated here). Reads the filtered-density local potential-energy fields (z₀(ρ̄), Υˡ, Dˡ, Ea(ρ̄,z)) back from `03`'s output instead of recomputing them -- see "Checkpointing and cross-script reuse" below |

**Checkpointing and cross-script reuse.** `05_sfs_ape_budget.py` originated the pattern both `03` and `04`
now also use: per filter scale, compute the budget, write it to a per-scale checkpoint file, `del`/
`gc.collect()` the in-memory/lazy result, then reopen the checkpoint lazily before moving to the next scale
-- bounds peak memory to ~1 filter scale regardless of scale count or time resolution, instead of every
scale's full (lazy) graph staying reachable until one final write at the end of the script. Checkpoints are
deleted once the script's own final output is written successfully; each script also skips recomputing a
scale whose checkpoint already exists on disk (resume-after-partial-failure, at the cost of silently reusing
a stale checkpoint if the input data changed underneath it without the checkpoint being cleaned up first).

`03_energy_transfer.py`'s `calculate_energy_transfer()` (`aux02_ke_functions.py`) already computes the
filtered-density local potential-energy fields (z₀(ρ̄), Υˡ, Dˡ, Ea(ρ̄,z), via
`local_potential_energies_timeseries()` on `ds_filt_ℓ`) per scale, purely as an intermediate for Π_A --
only Υˡ is actually used, the rest was discarded. `05_sfs_ape_budget.py` then independently called the
exact same function with the exact same inputs to get those same fields for real -- the same expensive
per-timestep computation run twice across the pipeline for one result. `calculate_energy_transfer()` gained
an `include_filt_local_pes=False` parameter (mirroring the existing `include_pi_k` pattern): when `03` sets
it `True`, those four fields ride along in the checkpoint/final-write machinery it already has, and
`05_sfs_ape_budget.py` reads them back (same `.sel(filter_scale=..., method="nearest")` pattern it already
uses to reuse Π_A from `03` and the APE→KE exchange term from `04`) instead of calling
`local_potential_energies_timeseries()` on `ds_filt_ℓ` itself. Falls back to the old direct-computation path
if `03`'s output predates the flag (e.g. rerunning `05` alone against an older `03` output), rather than
hard-failing. Off by default in `calculate_energy_transfer()` itself, since `sweep2_energy_transfer.py` (the
only other caller, typically run with many more filter scales) has no use for these fields and already has
a documented memory sensitivity at high scale counts (see below) that persisting more per-scale data would
only worsen.

`04_sfs_ke_budget.py` has an analogous, still-unfixed duplication with `03`: both independently compute
`b_r` (via `calculate_b_r`) and its filtered/exchange-term derivatives at the same filter scale, and `04`'s
copy is what `05` actually reads (via `ke_budget`, not `03`'s copy) -- so `03`'s own version of this
specific term is computed and persisted but never read by anything downstream. Since `04` doesn't share code
with `sweep2` the way `calculate_energy_transfer()` does, fixing this doesn't need an opt-in flag -- just
have `04` read `ape_to_ke_exchange`/`∫(SFS APE->KE) dV` from `03`'s `_energy_transfer.nc` (via
`load_energy_transfer()`, which `05` already uses) instead of recomputing them.

`aux01_pe_functions.py`'s `sorted_timeseries()` (used by `02_sort_density.py`) and
`local_potential_energies_timeseries()` (used inside `calculate_energy_transfer()` and directly by `05`)
used to (a) keep the full raw per-timestep input array reachable for the rest of the function after the
per-timestep sort/compute loop was done with it, and (b) build their `(time, ...)` outputs by appending
per-timestep `xr.DataArray`s to a Python list and then `xr.concat()`-ing a *second*, separate copy of the
same data -- meaning the list and the concatenated result were both alive simultaneously at peak, on top of
the still-reachable raw input. Both were the actual root cause behind two OOMs (a 512x512x128 grid-driven
failure inside `local_potential_energies_timeseries()`, and a 256x256x64/961-timestep failure inside
`sorted_timeseries()` -- see "Post-processing memory sizing" above). Fixed by reassigning the raw input to
`None` once the per-timestep loop is done with it (not `del`, since `sorted_timeseries()`'s `_run` closure
over the raw input means a bare `del` would only be safe because `_run` is never called again after that
point -- reassignment doesn't depend on that), and by filling pre-allocated `(time, ...)` arrays directly
instead of list-then-`concat()`. `sorted_timeseries()`'s `z_1d_sorted` coordinate (the sorted profile's
vertical positions) is computed once and asserted equal across all timesteps rather than left to
`xr.concat`'s own coordinate reconciliation -- it's provably time-invariant on this codebase's
uniform-cell-volume grid (reordering a constant array by any permutation returns the same array; confirmed
directly against real data), so a single shared value is correct, but the assertion means a future
non-uniform grid fails loudly here instead of silently dropping real per-timestep variation. Verified
bit-identical output before/after on a real (if small) local run, including budget-closure tests.

`aux00_utils.py`'s `GaussianFilter` class filters (x,y), both periodic (`mode='wrap'` on both), replacing
KH's (x periodic, z bounded `mode='nearest'`). `condense_velocities` (u,v,w) is used throughout instead of
KH's `condense_uw_velocities` (u,w only, valid for the 2D x-z KH case); w is now included fully in the
KE cross-scale tensors too (see the Πₖ note above), not excluded.

`validation/` and the standalone `plot*`/`anim1_panels.py` scripts still describe the KH pipeline's
online-vs-offline validation setup and have not been adapted -- there is no online Πₖ/ε_Kˢ to validate
against anymore. `anim2_surface_buoyancy.py` is new: a simple standalone script that animates the surface
buoyancy field to a GIF (no ffmpeg dependency, uses matplotlib's `PillowWriter`).

`sweep1_filter_fields.py` -> `sweep2_energy_transfer.py` -> `sweep3_plot_transfer_spectrum.py` (filter at
many log-spaced scales, compute Πₖ/Π_A at each, plot the resulting cross-scale transfer spectrum as a
Hovmöller of time vs. ℓ) have been adapted for BCI: `sweep1`'s filter-scale range is now data-driven
(`--scale-min`/`--scale-max` default to 2x the grid spacing and 40% of the domain width Lx respectively,
rather than the old hardcoded KH range in different units), `sweep2`'s log message now says "x and y" not
"x and z", and `sweep3`'s `SymLogNorm(linthresh=...)` scales with the data's own magnitude (`vmax*1e-3`)
instead of a fixed absolute value tuned for KH's much smaller Πₖ/Π_A magnitudes.

`sweep2` used to call `calculate_energy_transfer()` **once**, passing the *entire* `filter_scales` array
(unlike `03_energy_transfer.py`, which loops one scale at a time -- see "Checkpointing and cross-script
reuse" below). Without `--fixed-reference`, `rho_sorted`/`dz_sorted` start as `None`, so
`calculate_energy_transfer()` runs `sorted_timeseries()` itself -- but that call sits *before* its own `for
ℓ in filter_scales:` loop, so the sort happens once per `calculate_energy_transfer()` call, not once per
filter scale (correcting a stale claim this note used to make, confirmed directly by reading the code).
What *was* still true and expensive for a many-scale sweep: `calculate_energy_transfer()`'s per-scale loop
had no checkpointing (deliberately left alone when `03` got it, specifically so `sweep2` -- the loop's other
caller -- wouldn't be affected), so every scale's not-yet-computed `ape_to_ke_exchange`/`w̄·b̄ᵣ` (still lazy
even though `Π_A` itself is `.load()`ed and `filt_local_pes` freed per scale -- an earlier, narrower fix)
stayed reachable via the growing list `calculate_energy_transfer()` builds internally before its own single
`xr.concat()` at the end -- confirmed as the cause of a real OOM on a 384x384x64, n_scales=30 sweep run (see
the `filt_local_pes` comment in `aux02_ke_functions.py`), and again, worse, on a 512x512x64, 40-day run
(died mid-loop, at "Calculating cross-scale APE flux").

**Fixed**: `sweep2_energy_transfer.py` now loops over filter scales one at a time *at the script level*
(mirroring `03_energy_transfer.py`'s exact pattern) instead of delegating the whole array to
`calculate_energy_transfer()` in one call, checkpointing each scale's fully-computed result to disk via
`write_dataset()` (new `--write-mode load|synchronous` flag, same semantics as `03`'s) before freeing it and
moving to the next -- bounding peak memory to ~1 scale regardless of scale count. `calculate_energy_transfer()`
itself is still unchanged (both callers now use it identically: once per scale, with a single-element
`filter_scales` list), so this doesn't touch the function both scripts share. `sweep_transfer.pbs` defaults
`WRITE_MODE=synchronous` for the same reason `budgeting.pbs`/`budgeting_filter.pbs` do. Verified against
real local data: old and new code produce bit-identical output from the same input (all 8 variables, exact
`np.array_equal`), and the checkpoint-resume path (pre-seeding one scale's checkpoint) correctly skips
recomputing it. Parallelizing `sweep2` across scales -- still not done -- now has the natural per-scale seam
to submit as separate concurrent jobs that this restructuring was a prerequisite for.

`sweep3` also gained a second row of panels that was previously missing: it already computed a `1/ℓ`
coordinate (`inv_scale`) specifically so a proper spectrum line plot could use it as the x-axis, but the
plotting code only ever drew the Hovmöllers -- the spectrum itself was never implemented. Now it also plots
the time-mean (±1 std across time, excluding the first `--min-time-days` as an initial-transient cutoff)
of ∫Π_K dV/∫Π_A dV vs. 1/ℓ, with a dashed vertical line at the theoretical Eady deformation radius
`Ld = N·Lz/|f0|` (computed from the run's own `N2`/`Lz`/`latitude` attrs). The shaded band is temporal
spread of the diagnostic itself, not a statistical confidence interval -- there's only one simulation
realization, so don't read it as sampling uncertainty on the mean.

`anim3_panels.py` is also new: a 6-panel GIF animation (`--filename ...`, `--filter-scale` in meters,
`--fps`, `--dpi`, `--clim-percentile`) combining surface buoyancy, surface Rossby number ζ/f, the SFS
APE→KE "conversion" term, cross-scale KE/APE fluxes Πₖ/Π_A, and their sum, all at the top z-level, plus a
full-width bottom row with the SFS KE and APE budget time series (each with a vertical marker tracking the
current frame). Two things worth knowing if extending it:
- Some offline APE-pipeline fields (`Π_A`, the KE↔APE exchange term) are stored with dims `(..., x, y)`
  instead of `(..., y, x)` like every other field (`b`, `ζ`, `Π_K`) -- a real bug in how those DataArrays
  get built upstream (`aux01_pe_functions.py`), not just a plotting quirk. Plotting `.values` directly
  against `(x_km, y_km)` renders them rotated 90° relative to everything else. `anim3_panels.py`'s
  `fix_orientation()` transposes any field to `(..., y_dim, x_dim)` before plotting regardless of its
  stored order, so this can't recur there -- but any *other* script plotting `Π_A` or an exchange term
  directly (e.g. `plot6_snapshots.py`, which uses the same pattern) needs the same treatment.
- `constrained_layout` cannot reconcile equal-aspect square map axes sharing one GridSpec with a wide,
  non-square row (it silently fails -- "axes sizes collapsed to zero" -- and produces uneven gaps).
  `anim3_panels.py` avoids this with explicit `wspace`/`hspace`/margins plus fixed-fraction colorbars
  (`fraction=0.046, pad=0.04`) instead of relying on the layout solver.

`plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py` is new: conditions Πₖ, Π_A, and Πₖ+Π_A on the *filtered*-field vorticity
ζ̄/f0 and strain σ̄/|f0| (`--filename ...`, `--filter-scale` in meters, `--time-min`/`--time-max` in days
(default 15-30 days -- eddies should be fully developed by then; a fixed window rather than one tied to
each run's own length, so repeated runs/comparisons default to the same physical window), `--z` in meters,
`--n-bins`, `--min-count`, `--clim-percentile`), following the joint-PDF/conditional-mean method of
[Balwada et al. (2021, JPO)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-21-0016.1) but with our own cross-scale energy
fluxes in place of their vertical tracer flux. All snapshots in the `--time-min`/`--time-max` window are
pooled into one set of area-weighted samples for the JPDF/conditional-mean statistics (each snapshot
weighted equally regardless of Δt), not evaluated at a single instant -- reduces noise in the SD/AVD/CVD
flux fractions versus a single snapshot, at the cost of needing enough of a run's duration to actually reach
the window. If the run doesn't reach `--time-min` (default 15 days) at all, this is a hard error (the
window couldn't even start, and quietly plotting something from whatever scraps exist near the run's actual
end would be more confusing than failing loudly); if it reaches `--time-min` but not `--time-max` (default
30 days), the window is clipped to whatever's actually available and a warning is printed, rather than
erroring, since a shorter-than-requested-but-nonempty pooling window is still meaningful. `plots.pbs` leaves
both unset, using the fixed 15-30 day default for every run (see the "plots" stage entry above for why --
it used to override both to the run's own last 10 days instead, which turned out to be the more confusing
choice in practice). Produces, per filter scale: the JPDF, a conditional-mean panel and a "net contribution" panel
(conditional mean × JPDF) for each of the three flux quantities, plus the flux fraction attributable to
strain-dominated (SD) vs. vorticity-dominated (AVD/CVD) regions (the σ=|ζ̄| partition from the paper). f0 is
a single reference Coriolis value (evaluated at y=0), not local f(y), to keep the JPDF axes free of an
implicit y-dependence. Two gotchas hit while building it:
- `ūᵢ` (the filtered-velocity file) is *also* stored with `(..., x_caa, y_aca)` instead of `(..., y_aca,
  x_caa)` -- the same orientation bug as `Π_A`/the exchange term (see above), just in a different file.
  Uses the same `fix_orientation()` pattern.
- When overlaying the σ=|ζ| "V" boundary with `ax.plot(z, np.abs(z), ...)`, sampling `z` at only 2 points
  (the endpoints) draws a flat line at the max, not a V -- `np.abs` needs enough intermediate points to
  trace the actual piecewise-linear shape.

`plot3_budgets.py` had the same KH-era bug as the old `plot3_budgets_bci.py` scratch copy: a hardcoded
`ax.set_xlim(right=140)` (a leftover non-dimensional-time assumption from KH) that clipped almost the
entire BCI time axis, since our time coordinate is raw seconds up to ~10⁶. Fixed by plotting `time/86400`
(days) and dropping the `xlim` call entirely; also updated the default `--filter-scales` from KH's `[7,
1]` to BCI's `[50000.0, 100000.0]` (meters) and the per-panel `ℓ=` title to display km.

`plot6_snapshots.py` is new: a permanent version of the ad hoc mid-depth snapshot scripts used
earlier in this project's investigation (buoyancy, Rossby number ζ/f, cross-scale KE flux Πₖ, cross-scale
APE flux Π_A, single time/depth/filter-scale, 2x2 panel). Uses the same `fix_orientation()` and
`coriolis_f()` patterns as `anim3_panels.py`/`plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py` (`--filename`,
`--filter-scale` in meters, `--time` in days, `--z` in meters, `--clim-percentile`). Originally named
`plot6_middepth_snapshots.py`; renamed once `--z` made "mid-depth" no longer accurate (it can plot any
depth, e.g. `plots.pbs`'s own surface pass). All `pcolormesh` calls across the pipeline (`plot5`, `plot6`,
`anim3_panels.py`) call `im.set_edgecolor("face")` to avoid a known rendering artifact (thin white seams
between adjacent quads, from each quad being antialiased against its neighbors independently). Deliberately
**not** also passing `linewidth=0`, despite that being the commonly-suggested pairing: verified empirically
(zoomed-in raster comparison, real data) that `linewidth=0` alone does nothing here -- 0 collapses to a
hairline stroke rather than truly disabling it, leaving the antialiasing gap exposed regardless of edge
color. Leaving `linewidth` untouched (matplotlib's own nonzero default) is what makes `edgecolor="face"`
actually work: the stroke it paints is nonzero-width and same-color-as-fill, so it paints over the gap.

`plot7_flux_phase_space.py` is new: a 2x3 panel of net cross-scale flux contribution (conditional mean ×
JPDF, same concept as `plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py`'s net-contribution row) for Πₖ, Π_A, Πₖ+Π_A
(columns), shown in two different filtered-field phase spaces (rows) -- vorticity-strain (ζ̄/f0, σ̄/|f0|,
row 1) and vorticity-divergence (ζ̄/f0, δ̄/|f0|, row 2, δ̄ = ∂ū/∂x + ∂v̄/∂y). Shares `plot5`'s data-loading
pipeline verbatim (`fix_orientation()`, the `ConsecutiveIterations` pair dedup, `--time-min`/`--time-max`
pooling with the same 15-30 day default and duration error-checking) rather than importing from it --
matches this pipeline's existing convention of small helper duplication across sibling `plot5`/`plot6`/
`anim3_panels.py` scripts (e.g. `fix_orientation()` itself) rather than centralizing everything in
`aux03_plotting.py`. The JPDF/conditional-mean/net-contribution machinery is generalized into local
functions (`compute_jpdf()`, `cond_mean_and_net()`, `percentile_levels()`) parameterized over an arbitrary
(x, y) phase-space pair, since this script -- unlike `plot5` -- applies that machinery twice per flux
quantity, once per row, each with its own JPDF (row 1 and row 2 are genuinely different distributions, not
just different aggregations of the same one). Two things follow from that: δ̄'s bin edges are symmetric
about zero (`-div_max` to `+div_max`), unlike σ̄'s one-sided `0` to `sigma_max` -- divergence can be negative
(convergence), unlike a strain magnitude -- and row 2 gets a `δ=0` reference line instead of row 1's `σ=|ζ|`
SD/AVD/CVD boundary (that specific partition is a vorticity-strain-space concept from Balwada et al. with no
obvious equivalent in vorticity-divergence space, so row 2 doesn't attempt one). Both rows' JPDF contour
legend is unified into a single figure-level legend keyed by *percentile position* in `--percentiles`
(matching linestyle to list position, not to sorted contour value) -- "50% HDR" means the same thing
(the region containing 50% of that row's own probability mass) in both rows even though the two rows' actual
density thresholds for that percentile differ, the same way percentile-based color limits already stay
meaningful across different filter scales elsewhere in this pipeline.

**Plot units audited: everything energy-related is per-unit-mass (Boussinesq), m² s⁻² for energy densities
and m² s⁻³ for transfer/dissipation rates -- there is no ρ₀ factor anywhere in the actual KE-side
computation (`aux02_ke_functions.py`), matching the APE side's own explicit `g·ρ·z/ρ0` convention
(`aux01_pe_functions.py`).** `calculate_cross_scale_ke_flux()` had a stale docstring claiming a `Πℓ = -ρ₀
S̄:τ̄` formula the code never actually implements (the real return statement, and its own `[m² s⁻³]`
return-value docstring two lines below, already agreed with each other and had no ρ₀ factor) -- corrected
the prose to match the code instead of the other way around, since introducing a real ρ₀ multiply would
have been the wrong fix (it would produce kg m⁻¹ s⁻³, not m² s⁻³). Two genuinely different kinds of
quantity get plotted across this pipeline, and only one of them was actually mislabeled/wrong:
- Raw fields (Πₖ, Π_A, ε_Kˢ, ε_Aˢ, the SFS APE→KE conversion term, as plotted in `plot5`/`plot6`/`anim3`'s
  map panels) are already genuinely m² s⁻³ -- these only needed colorbar `label=` kwargs added (previously
  none of these colorbars had any unit label at all). Buoyancy panels (`plot6`/`anim3`) are `m s⁻²`
  (an acceleration, not an energy quantity); Rossby number ζ/f panels are dimensionless (no label).
- The *budget-panel* plots (`plot3_budgets.py`'s 2×2 KE/APE panel, `anim3_panels.py`'s bottom time-series
  row, `sweep3_plot_transfer_spectrum.py`'s Hovmöller + spectrum) plot `∫...dV` terms from
  `04_sfs_ke_budget.py`/`05_sfs_ape_budget.py` -- `integrate()` (`aux00_utils.py`) is a raw `(field *
  dV).sum()`, so these come out in m⁵ s⁻³ (a per-unit-mass rate integrated over the domain's actual m³
  volume), not m² s⁻³, and previously had no unit label either -- silently plotting numbers many orders of
  magnitude off from what a "m² s⁻³" reader would expect. Fixed by dividing every term (including the
  bottom-drag term, which is `∫...dA` not `∫...dV` -- see the CLI-args section above) by the domain volume
  `V = Lx·Ly·Lz` (read from the budget file's own attrs) before plotting, giving a genuine domain-averaged
  rate in m² s⁻³ that's now directly comparable to the raw-field plots above. Dividing the boundary
  (area-integrated) term by the *volume* rather than its own area is deliberate, not an inconsistency: a
  surface flux's contribution to a volume-averaged tendency is `(∮flux dA)/V` by the divergence theorem --
  the same normalization every bulk (volume-integrated) term in the same budget equation gets.

### Key dependencies
- **Python**: `numpy`, `xarray`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `dask`, `gcm_filters`, `netcdf4`
- **Julia**: `Oceananigans` v0.110.8, `Oceanostics` v0.18.0 (pinned to the `tc/sfs-ke` branch -- see the
  Notes entry on the online Πₖ/ε_Kˢ switch, and the separate Notes entry below on a newer `main`-branch
  Oceanostics module this pin doesn't include), `NCDatasets`, `CairoMakie` (Julia 1.11.2)

## Physics Reference

- **TPE** = integral of g*rho*z dV (total potential energy)
- **RPE** = minimum PE achievable by adiabatic rearrangement (from sorted reference state)
- **APE** = TPE - RPE (available for conversion to KE)
- **Πₖ**, **Π_A** -- cross-scale energy transfer (sub-filter to resolved). Both are full 3D/unrestricted:
  Π_A always was (density/APE has no analogous "diagnostic component" issue), and Πₖ is too now that w is
  prognostic (see Architecture) -- it was horizontal-only under the earlier hydrostatic setup.
- Physical constants: `g=9.81`, `rho_0=1025`

## Code Style

- Do not break a command/statement into multiple lines if it fits within 140 columns.
- Always delimit code sections with `#+++` on the opening line and `#---` on the closing line:
  ```python
  #+++ Section name
  ...code...
  #---
  ```

## Notes

- **The raw simulation time axis is pairs, not independent samples -- matters for any offline script that
  pools/averages over a time range.** `baroclinic_adjustment.jl`'s `:fields` writer (and `:bottom`, when
  `--bottom_drag`) uses `schedule = ConsecutiveIterations(TimeInterval(output_interval))`, which writes TWO
  consecutive model iterations -- the nominal output time, then the very next iteration (~seconds to ~15
  minutes later, depending on the adaptive Δt at that point in the run) -- at every nominal output time.
  This is deliberate: `aux02_ke_functions.py`'s `calculate_sfs_ke_tendency()` needs a close pair straddling
  each nominal output time to finite-difference an accurate ∂ₜ(SFS KE)/∂ₜ(SFS APE), rather than differencing
  across the full output interval. Confirmed directly on real data: consecutive pairs' own internal gap plus
  the following gap to the next pair always sums to exactly the nominal `output_interval` (e.g. `607.4s +
  42592.6s = 43200s = 12h` exactly). `01_filter_fields.py` (and everything built on its output --
  `filtered_velocities.nc`, and in turn `03`/`04`/`05`'s own outputs) inherits this raw paired structure
  unchanged; it's never collapsed except where a script explicitly computes a tendency the way
  `calculate_sfs_ke_tendency()` does (`.diff("time").sel(time=slice(None, None, 2))`, itself only valid
  because of this pairing). Any *other* script that treats the time axis as independent, regularly-spaced
  samples at the nominal output frequency -- e.g. pooling/averaging over a `--time-min`/`--time-max`-style
  range -- will silently process roughly double the expected sample count, double-weighting each real
  snapshot's near-identical pair partner rather than genuinely pooling that many independent samples.
  Caught via a real report: `plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py` printed "41 snapshots" for a 10-day window at a
  12h output interval (expected 21). Fixed in `plot5_vorticity_strain_flux.py` and
  `sweep3_plot_transfer_spectrum.py` (both pool/average over a time range) by keeping only the first member
  of each pair -- `ds.isel(time=slice(0, None, 2))` -- applied to the *full*, unsliced time axis immediately
  after loading, before any `--time-min`/`--time-max`/`--min-time-days` selection, so the pair parity stays
  anchored to the simulation start regardless of the chosen window. `sweep1_filter_fields.py`'s
  `--n-time-skip` already accounted for this correctly (`(i // 2) % n_time_skip == 0`, dividing the raw
  index by 2 before the skip logic) -- if extending this fix to more scripts, that's the existing precedent
  to match. `plot3_budgets.py` (each raw point plotted as its own point on a line) and `anim3_panels.py`
  (each raw point is its own animation frame) show the same underlying duplication but only as a cosmetic
  double-point/stutter, not a statistical pooling bias, and were left as-is.
- **Oceanostics bug (fixed)**: `GaussianFilter(; dims=(1,2), σ)` used to crash (heap corruption -> SIGILL)
  on a grid with real `Ny>1` and periodic y -- filed as
  [tomchor/Oceanostics.jl#262](https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl/issues/262), with a minimal
  reproducer; fixed in v0.17.3 ([PR #263](https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl/pull/263), root cause
  was a multi-direction filter's staged kernel launch being sized from the operand instead of the
  destination field, which broke specifically for *windowed* destinations like this repo's
  `indices=(:, :, grid.Nz)` surface output writer). The `SequentialGaussianFilter` workaround this repo used
  to carry (two sequential 1D passes instead of one `dims=(1,2)` call) has been removed now that the native
  filter works directly; Πₖ/ε_Kˢ are computed online (see Architecture) instead of deferred offline.
- **Oceanostics gained an online APE module (on `main`, not yet in this repo's `tc/sfs-ke` pin).** PRs #272,
  #274, #276 (merged 2026-07-22 through 2026-07-31 -- all *after* `tc/sfs-ke`'s own 2026-07-16 merge, so this
  repo's pin doesn't include them) added `AvailablePotentialEnergyEquation`, providing
  `AvailablePotentialEnergy`/`BuoyancyDisplacementPotential` (Υ, this codebase's `upsilon`)/
  `AvailablePotentialEnergyDissipationRate` (ε_A, this codebase's `ε_Aˢ`-adjacent quantity)/
  `PotentialToKineticEnergyConversion` online -- the APE-side analog of the Πₖ/ε_Kˢ online-diagnostic move
  above. The PR description validates ε_A against "an independent offline (Python) implementation" in "a
  Kelvin-Helmholtz APE study" -- almost certainly this codebase's own lineage (`CoarseGrainedKHAPE`). No
  ready-made cross-scale APE flux (Π_A) diagnostic exists there yet -- the PR describes the contraction (Υ
  with a sub-filter buoyancy flux) but doesn't implement it as a named function, so getting Π_A online would
  still need new Julia code, analogous to `KineticEnergyCrossScaleFlux`. Moving ε_A/the exchange term online
  would eliminate real, currently-offline cost in `04_sfs_ke_budget.py`/`05_sfs_ape_budget.py` (see the
  Gaussian-filter scaling note below for why that cost is real and grows with resolution) -- but only for
  *future* simulation runs; the online fields don't exist retroactively for already-completed `.nc` files.
  Moving the pin off `tc/sfs-ke` (to a tagged release or `main`) is a prerequisite for any of this.
- **NonhydrostaticModel replaced HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel+ImplicitFreeSurface.** Motivated by comparing
  against tomchor's own Eady baroclinic-instability example (Oceanostics PR #260,
  `docs/examples/eady_baroclinic_instability.jl`), which uses `NonhydrostaticModel` and closes its
  coarse-grained filtered-KE budget to ~11-15% residual/dominant -- much better than this repo's ~40-60%
  at the time. Switching just the model type (keeping our own closure/advection/resolution otherwise fixed)
  did *not* reproduce that improvement on its own (~40-45% either way), ruling out the free surface as the
  sole cause. A live, ongoing investigation into tomchor's example (run standalone, outside this repo) found
  that swapping his buoyancy-production-term convention (`w̄b̄`, using the raw filtered perturbation
  buoyancy) for this repo's own convention (`w̄b̄ᵣ`, using a Winters-sorted reference-state buoyancy)
  substantially degrades *his* closure too when done carelessly (dramatically, if the sort mistakenly
  includes the front's own horizontally-varying background buoyancy, which double-counts energy already
  captured by his separate mean-shear production term `Pu` -- only the horizontally-uniform, z-only part of
  a background field can be added to a buoyancy production term "for free", by an exact incompressibility
  argument: horizontal-mean w is exactly zero at every z in a periodic, impermeable-boundary domain). The
  corrected version of that test (background restricted to the z-only stratification) was in progress when
  the model switch was made permanent here; check conversation history for its outcome before assuming the
  buoyancy-convention question is resolved one way or the other. The NonhydrostaticModel switch itself is
  being kept regardless, since it removes the free surface's own complications (no η, no barotropic
  pressure-correction term, no dimension-inference limitation when trying to output η) and makes w a
  properly prognostic variable, matching tomchor's own validated approach -- but it should be treated as an
  ongoing architecture change, not a settled fix for the closure gap.
- **Budget closure gap was (mostly) explained by a domain-padding bug -- fixed.** `aux00_utils.py`'s
  `load_dataset_and_grid()` used to call a `_pad_domain_in_z()` helper that doubled the z-domain via
  edge-value replication before recomputing `dV`, left over from the old KH pipeline where filtering also
  operated in z. It served no purpose once filtering became horizontal-only, but silently remained, so every
  volume integral computed via `integrate()` throughout this entire fork's history (everything downstream of
  `load_dataset_and_grid`: all of 01-05, `plot4_panels.py`, `S2_panels.py`, `inv06_total_mixing_check.py`,
  `S4_thumbnail.py`, the `sweep*` scripts) summed over roughly twice the physical domain, with the padded
  cells inflating each budget term by a *different*, term-specific factor (measured on one dataset/timestep:
  Πₖ 1.96x, εˡ 1.25x, ε_Kˢ 1.48x, raw w 9.21x) rather than a uniform scale that would cancel in a residual.
  Found during a code review requested specifically to look for bugs affecting the large-scale KE budget;
  confirmed via direct numerical test, then removed entirely (function and call site) per explicit
  instruction, since padding-in-z has no remaining purpose. Grep-confirmed no other code depends on it.
  Re-running the full 01->04 pipeline on `bci_Nx96_Ny96_Nz16_nonhydro` after the fix dropped the filtered
  (large-scale) KE budget residual/dominant from 39.6%/46.2% to **6.2%/4.6%** (ℓ=50/100km) -- right in the
  range of tomchor's own Eady-example floor (~11-15%, see above), essentially closing the multi-week
  "budgets don't converge with resolution" investigation. All closure percentages quoted anywhere earlier in
  this file or in conversation history predate this fix and should be treated as unreliable until
  regenerated; the buoyancy-convention investigation above became moot once this fix landed (see the
  "definitive, exact result" in conversation history: `w̄b̄` and `w̄b̄ᵣ` are provably identical for our own
  simulation regardless of the padding bug, since it never affected that particular identity). Still open:
  whether this fix changes closure at other resolutions (e.g. 192x192x32), and whether the SFS KE budget
  (as opposed to the filtered/large-scale one) improves comparably.
- **Minor, unresolved: Gaussian filter truncation-radius mismatch.** Oceanostics' online `GaussianFilter`
  defaults to a 2σ truncation radius (`ceil(Int, 2σ/Δ)` grid cells); this repo's offline
  `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d` defaults to 4σ (`truncate=4.0`). Verified numerically on a real w field:
  ~1.3% relative rms difference, 0.9999 correlation -- real but small, not yet fixed.
- **Significant, unresolved: Gaussian filter cost scales worse than linearly with grid resolution.**
  `GaussianFilter` (`aux00_utils.py`) sets kernel width in *grid points* from the physical filter scale ℓ and
  the grid spacing (`σ_x = ℓ · _FWHM_TO_SIGMA / dx_min`) -- for a fixed physical ℓ and domain size, σ (in grid
  points) grows linearly with resolution, since dx shrinks. `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d` is a *direct*
  (non-FFT) correlation, cost `O(L·σ)` per line, not `O(L)` -- so doubling both horizontal grid dimensions for
  the same physical filter scale roughly doubles the data volume but **~8x's the filtering cost** (L doubles,
  σ doubles → 4x per line, x2 more lines from the other dimension also doubling). Reasoned through after a
  real report: sweep per-scale cost went from ~1 min at 256x256x128 to >20 min at 512x512x128 (only 4x the
  grid). The ~8x from filtering alone doesn't account for the full ~20x (there's also a smaller `O(N log N)`
  contribution from the sort/searchsorted calls, plus likely cache/memory-bandwidth effects at 4x the data),
  but it's the dominant, clearly-identifiable mechanism, and it gets worse the larger the filter scale is
  relative to grid spacing -- true of most of the sweep's own scale range, since it spans from ~2 grid points
  up to 40% of the domain width. Since this domain is fully doubly-periodic (already true throughout this
  codebase), an FFT-based Gaussian filter (`O(L log L)`, independent of σ) is a natural, exact fit and would
  turn this into close-to-linear scaling with data volume -- not yet implemented. This is a bigger lever for
  *scaling to larger grids* specifically than any of the memory/redundant-computation fixes in the
  Architecture section, which are constant-factor wins; this one fixes the scaling exponent itself.
- **Verified: the Gaussian filter is exactly mean-preserving and zero-phase.** Domain mean of a filtered
  field matches the unfiltered mean to floating-point precision (0.00e+00 relative difference, checked at
  three filter scales against real `b`/`u` fields) -- expected from a normalized kernel (`gaussian_filter1d`'s
  weights sum to 1) convolved periodically (`mode='wrap'`), which always exactly conserves the domain sum;
  this is the property the cross-scale energy budget framework needs (large-scale + sub-filter-scale has to
  sum back to the total). Filtered values also never exceed the raw field's range (a property of Gaussian
  kernels' all-positive weights -- a weighted average can't overshoot, unlike a sharp spectral cutoff filter).
  Also verified zero phase/spatial shift directly via the filter's impulse response (filtering a single
  delta-function spike): centroid offset from the spike's own location was 0.00e+00 grid cells in x, ~1e-15
  (floating-point roundoff) in y, with exact left/right symmetry at every offset. Expected from any symmetric
  (even, non-causal) kernel -- unlike the causal IIR filters `scipy.signal.filtfilt` exists to fix, a Gaussian
  kernel is already zero-phase by construction, so there's no need for (and no benefit from) a
  forward-backward filtfilt-style pass here.
- `online_ke_transfer_validation.md` is a KH-era dev note about computing Πₖ online and validating it against
  the offline pipeline -- it predates both this fork's move to fully-offline Πₖ/ε_Kˢ and the subsequent move
  back to online (see above), so it still doesn't describe current behavior, though the general idea
  (validate online against offline before trusting it) is exactly what was done again for this switch.
